### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I enjoy using Python and Statistics to optimize ads and improve marketing campaigns.
I'm currently on the lookout for a Data Science role, ideally working with Python, SQL and Tableau. 
I'd especially love to work at a startup on a tight knit team where I can make an impact quickly. 
If you're hiring, let's chat!
